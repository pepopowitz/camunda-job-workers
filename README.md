really quick instructions that I just threw together in two minutes:

1. install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Configure a .env file in the root of this project, with all the API settings from your camunda instance
3. Rewrite index.js according to the exercise
4. run the index.js, in your terminal, with `node index.js`.
