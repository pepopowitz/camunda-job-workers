- it's easy to fall behind, and once you're behind, there's no obvious way to get back on track.
  - are there any existing assets that you share with customers to get them back on track?
  - or links to working examples at least to look at?
  - do you do breakout rooms? It'd be nice to work as a small group, in case anyone has fallen off track, they can still see things happening with someone else driving.
